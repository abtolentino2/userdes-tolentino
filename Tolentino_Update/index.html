          <p><strong>Hello! I am Anzel Clarenz Tolentino, student from Asia Pacific College. </strong></p>
          <p>
Originally from the city of Pasay. Graduated Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics strand on
Senior High School also in Asia Pacific College. My capabilities as a student is not the high caliber type, mainly because
I mostly do what I want to do other than having a fully academical mindset. Some would say that it's mediocre and irresponsible but I disagree,
because I know my limitations and I always believed that it's always important to be balanced. 
By balanced I mean it always depends of which environment I am with. If I was in home I would prioritize my family, If I was around my friend obviously I would socialize
and if I was in school then I would think academically. 
Choosing IT course is one of my biggest risk. Given that my interest in technology is highly curious, Information Technology course is one of the most difficult but in demand in the society, 
by the reason of feeding my curiousity and seeking opportunity I took the biggest risk of my life and now I may be struggling but I know it would be worth it.

In terms of personal life. I do nothing much as a hobby, I'm not sporty despite my physical potential, therefore I'm more likely in front of the computer to entertain myself. Sometimes I read fictional books
when there are no internet or electricity because I like to imagine things out of the words I've red. It's pretty boring to know what I was doing for entertainment but I'm contended on everything that I do.           </p>

	<h2><strong>Reflection 1</strong></h2>
	<p>The first week of class sessions of USERDES class is not that I expected because
although I came in late, I thought our professor would ask me things like why I came in late, but
she’s focused in giving instructions. Therefore, I followed those instructions and as we all do it
further instructions came again which helped and amazed all of us honestly.
At first since the subject talks about user design and interface I thought we’re already
heading for a coding review because given that we’re sophomore students I thought that our
professor would assume that we could start already, good thing that we started smoothly by
having us discuss every possible definition of design. Honestly on my opinion, I always thought
“design” would just involve how a specific thing looks promising to the chosen community, I
thought how things are functioned was out of design’s capability to create. Right now, the way I
think about “design” is quite broad because I now think not just it’s supposed to be visually but
how it is supposed to work, from mechanical to program, the way to think what is necessary for
the design of all things should, and what could be the better and most efficient way to create
such product. After presenting most of the favorite applications, the discussion of us about
design takes place upon analyzing what are the capabilities of each application and what could
be added in a way that it can be better.
This week of USERDES I could say that it gave me additional information from what I
thought I knew before. I was quite impressed that even with just the examples on the board our
professor executes the discussion very well and delivered points where we could understand
better.</p>

		<li><strong>Problem: Smartphones tend to be distractive while learning because of the connectivity it offers. The presence of smartphones affect the focus a student as one tries to check notifications to stay connected from time to time. </li></strong>
		<li><strong>Supporting study: Researchers found that students sending and receiving messages while studying scored lower test results and were less effective at tasks such as note taking. It found that when students did not use mobiles, they were better at being able to recall information. (BBC)</li></strong>
		<p>We could easily place our phones to somewhere out of reach while studying to avoid this kind of distraction. But in this time of digitalization, learning materials are now becoming electronic and most of it can be easily accessed through our mobile phones. This now beats the purpose of placing your phone somewhere else because you now need it for studying. In addition, emergencies are mostly addressed through our phones which is why need it around almost all the time.</p>
		<li><strong>Supporting study: Cell phones give students access to tools and apps that can help them complete and stay on top of their class work. These tools can also teach students to develop better study habits, like time management and organization skills. (Oxford Learning)</strong></li>
		<li><strong>App Solution:	Our group came up with an app idea solution for this problem which is, Study Lock. We find it very helpful to have this kind of app because all of us review our lecture notes in our mobile phones because it’s easier and paperless. Our app’s main feature is the complete lock, which will lock the phone from all of its features excluding emergency call features and partial lock, for selected apps only, for span of time set by the user. Both will be very effective as most people tend to still check their phones even without notification or any alerts receive. This will allow users to have undivided focus during study sessions.</strong></li>
