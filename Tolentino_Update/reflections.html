	<h2><strong>Reflection 1</strong></h2>
	<p>The first week of class sessions of USERDES class is not that I expected because
although I came in late, I thought our professor would ask me things like why I came in late, but
she’s focused in giving instructions. Therefore, I followed those instructions and as we all do it
further instructions came again which helped and amazed all of us honestly.
At first since the subject talks about user design and interface I thought we’re already
heading for a coding review because given that we’re sophomore students I thought that our
professor would assume that we could start already, good thing that we started smoothly by
having us discuss every possible definition of design. Honestly on my opinion, I always thought
“design” would just involve how a specific thing looks promising to the chosen community, I
thought how things are functioned was out of design’s capability to create. Right now, the way I
think about “design” is quite broad because I now think not just it’s supposed to be visually but
how it is supposed to work, from mechanical to program, the way to think what is necessary for
the design of all things should, and what could be the better and most efficient way to create
such product. After presenting most of the favorite applications, the discussion of us about
design takes place upon analyzing what are the capabilities of each application and what could
be added in a way that it can be better.
This week of USERDES I could say that it gave me additional information from what I
thought I knew before. I was quite impressed that even with just the examples on the board our
professor executes the discussion very well and delivered points where we could understand
better.</p>
	<h2><strong>Reflection 2</strong></h2>
	<p>As for need finding, we had a difficult time conceptualizing what could be fixed or what is
needed. However, before that I always look upon solutions from simple problems not knowing there are
much simpler solutions that can be done.
That’s why upon conceptualizing, our group looked upon other solutions that could get better
with different process and came up with an idea of our initial application. But because it doesn’t
provide that much solution it doesn’t meet our professor’s expectation, and she gave us instructions of
how could our application be effective on the user’s perspective. Through the week, we had difficulties
identifying the problem and the needs of our desired application but in the end, we’ve came up with
some and will get it improved as days pass.
We’ve created an interface of our mobile application in paper, but it doesn’t seem to be final
because we don’t know just yet if we could pull-off such ambition on an interface with our current
knowledge and experience in I.T. but rest assured that we are doing our best to meet that expectation
and focus on our intent on our desired application.</p>
	<h2><strong>Reflection 3</strong></h2>
	<p>I’ve created a web application way too long ago before Miss Jen told us to do so, that’s why everything feels so new when I’m coding in html and css again for a very long time. But upon recalling what it’s like to code in doing a web application it’s fun to experiment once again in coding in html.
Although the web application I’ve created right now is just a basic application without even a function inside of it. I wanted to level it up a little more not just for me to use it but also for the other users to possibly navigate the web app itself. Because initially when opening my newly created web app, it’s so plainly created that it has higher possibility that other users might find it boring. But as long as I can remember all of the learnings I got from the past years of programming, I’m sure I can achieve that navigating worthy web application.
It is quite fun experimenting and creating a web application but as soon as I need to create a specific web app, I need to know when to use a particular function to meet the expectations of the other users that will navigate throughout the web app itself.</p>
    <h2><strong>Reflection 4</strong></h2>
	<p>Userinyerface web application is not the best web application out there but it speaks the importance of having a user-friendly web application in order for the user to navigate easily and properly. Userinyerface on the other hand, is the exact opposite of a user-friendly application because it requires unusual inputs from the user leading them to stall longer from a single page to another.
From my experience, upon entering Userinyerface the color scheme seems to be more contradicting from the text because green means to confirm and the green circle contains a text saying “No” so I think every user might find this unusual and wrong. Also, the direction to get in the next page is quite bothering because the underlined text is not on “here” while most of the redirecting URL does that. Entering the next page which has the form to fill-in, every text box has texts that the user should delete first before entering their desired texts. When the user gets away from the keyboard, there’s a pop-up that will indicate your time and it will not exit til the user closed it, but the thing is the close button is not on the upper-right side but instead it’s on the lower-left spelled with the copyright symbols which confuses me as a user because it is wrong again. Finishing the form will get the user into the terms and conditions but this terms has a very slow scrolling experience, but upon knowing the logic of this web-page I’ve activated the find bar and searched for the word “fast” and found an instruction that to scroll faster I should hold “Alt” button with it. The filling-in the form is the page where I’ve been stalled the most but the rest pages after it was easy for me.
Just by knowing that the application is tricking me, I’ve thought of doing what is not to do properly because everything in this web application is not supposed to be user friendly. On the good side of the story this application just enlightens it user of having a uniformed and complete design that will not led its users to confusion.</p>
	<h2><strong>Reflection 5</strong></h2>
	<p>This year’s SOCIT week as a sophomore for me, the atmosphere of being in a SOCIT week has changed. Maybe because the hype of being a freshman doesn’t have the same excitement as before but nevertheless this year’s SOCIT week has been very beneficial that’s why for me it’s not that bad because this year instead of games and party, we had a lot of activities and seminars related to my course that’s why it’s been an academical SOCIT week for me this year.
	As a listener and learner from the recent SOCIT week, I can say that everything we have listened to and everything that we’re supposed to watch through has been very informative on what path we should take as we come along from being a professional programmers in the future. These statements were presented by Ms. Rhea which interests me the most because she’s a chill type of person to present a highly anticipated information to learn given for us. 
	My only expectation for next year’s SOCIT week is that it could be more exciting and interesting because having it more academically tends to create information overload and it doesn’t interest other people to participate in a fest that’s more academically prepared. 
	</p>
	<h2><strong>Reflection 6</strong></h2>
	<p>Going into a course of user design I already had a hint that this course would involve programs that would get interacted by the target users. Honestly speaking, for me the first half of user design class was clearly a refreshment class for me because I get to create personal websites again like what we used to do when we were in senior high. Personally, I like coding with these languages more because I get to see the very raw output of the program itself. Other than that there are other exercises and activities which is a bit interesting for me because I got to design a thousand floor elevator, I got to interact on a website that’s not user friendly, but on the bright side I got to solve and analyze what could be best to be improved on these things that I should properly expound.  The weekly reflection paper is not giving much difficulty not just on me, but I assume for the rest of the class as well, honestly this is the easiest activity given to us and it’s a good way to evaluate every student’s progress.
	The only part of this class that gives us too much pressure is the group project because we tend to have so much errors on our work that needs correction. Our group doesn’t exactly have the compatibility of schedule on each of us that’s why it gives us a much amount of difficulty to take. However, it is presented well but honestly, I think we can still be better. I hope that could happen in the finals even if it is expected to be a much harder than before, but I think that’s just what we need to develop ourselves.
	The finals is only a few weeks away, I hope the class atmosphere will be the same because the learning technique from it was effective. However I wouldn’t expect less since it is the finals period, better to expect the worst than to feel pressured from what could happen from the rest of the days of the USERDES class.
