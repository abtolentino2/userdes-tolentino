          <p><strong>Hello! I am Anzel Clarenz Tolentino, student from Asia Pacific College. </strong></p>
          <p>
Originally from the city of Pasay. Graduated Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics strand on
Senior High School also in Asia Pacific College. My capabilities as a student is not the high caliber type, mainly because
I mostly do what I want to do other than having a fully academical mindset. Some would say that it's mediocre and irresponsible but I disagree,
because I know my limitations and I always believed that it's always important to be balanced. 
By balanced I mean it always depends of which environment I am with. If I was in home I would prioritize my family, If I was around my friend obviously I would socialize
and if I was in school then I would think academically. 
Choosing IT course is one of my biggest risk. Given that my interest in technology is highly curious, Information Technology course is one of the most difficult but in demand in the society, 
by the reason of feeding my curiousity and seeking opportunity I took the biggest risk of my life and now I may be struggling but I know it would be worth it.

In terms of personal life. I do nothing much as a hobby, I'm not sporty despite my physical potential, therefore I'm more likely in front of the computer to entertain myself. Sometimes I read fictional books
when there are no internet or electricity because I like to imagine things out of the words I've red. It's pretty boring to know what I was doing for entertainment but I'm contended on everything that I do.           </p>

          <p><strong>Youtube</strong></p>
          <p>
My mostly used application so far is Youtube so I considered it as my favorite application.
I always go to Youtube when it comes to pasting time and entertaining myself, there's no other application
that can do it better than watching random videos on Youtube. 
It is a video-sharing application that has the features to upload, view, rate, share, add to playlists, report, comment on videos, and subscribe to other users.
Most of the time I start Youtube to mainly entertain and watch really interesting how to's, what if's videos,
and eventually go into real life events such as wildlife and the cosmos. It's quite entertaining and somehow informative
to watch videos randomly because I get to be knowledgeable while enjoying watching on things I didn't know from the first place.
I get to access Youtube since I discovered internet because watching videos really entertains me the most, given that the internet when I was a child was overwhelming me.
For me I think Youtube is the best application for entertaining one's self because one gets to decide what they wanted to watch, although there are restrictions for graphic contents,
but most of the contents from the videos uploaded in Youtube doesn't have those restrictions, in fact if there are videos that contains graphic content and doesn't have restrictions
that video can be taken down by Youtube itself for violating Youtube's rules and regulations. But overall Youtube can prove itself to be the best application in terms of entertainment, wether it would be from music, gaming, and much more contents.   </p>

		<li><strong>Problem: Smartphones tend to be distractive while learning because of the connectivity it offers. The presence of smartphones affect the focus a student as one tries to check notifications to stay connected from time to time. </li></strong>
		<li><strong>Supporting study: Researchers found that students sending and receiving messages while studying scored lower test results and were less effective at tasks such as note taking. It found that when students did not use mobiles, they were better at being able to recall information. (BBC)</li></strong>
		<p>We could easily place our phones to somewhere out of reach while studying to avoid this kind of distraction. But in this time of digitalization, learning materials are now becoming electronic and most of it can be easily accessed through our mobile phones. This now beats the purpose of placing your phone somewhere else because you now need it for studying. In addition, emergencies are mostly addressed through our phones which is why need it around almost all the time.</p>
		<li><strong>Supporting study: Cell phones give students access to tools and apps that can help them complete and stay on top of their class work. These tools can also teach students to develop better study habits, like time management and organization skills. (Oxford Learning)</strong></li>
		<li><strong>App Solution:	Our group came up with an app idea solution for this problem which is, Study Lock. We find it very helpful to have this kind of app because all of us review our lecture notes in our mobile phones because it’s easier and paperless. Our app’s main feature is the complete lock, which will lock the phone from all of its features excluding emergency call features and partial lock, for selected apps only, for span of time set by the user. Both will be very effective as most people tend to still check their phones even without notification or any alerts receive. This will allow users to have undivided focus during study sessions.</strong></li>

			This is Nathan, a simple student of Asia Pacific College. Nathan finds college really difficult, because it demands to be prioritized rather than balanced.
			To do that, Nathan is finding a way to set aside using social media platform applications when it's his time to study to lessen noise and undistracted focus.
